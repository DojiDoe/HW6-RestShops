#RestShops

Create a spring footwear project "Shops". They have to create a model of a store in the class
be the following fields: address, city and street where the store is located, name of the store and
the number of employees, and whether the field is available in the site store. Create a controller in
which will include the following operations:
1) create a new store,
2) delete the store (by ID),
3) get a list of all stores,
4) get a store by ID
5) change the fields of the store (by ID) - you can change all fields except the ID.
Check the functionality through postman, idea or any.
Make sure CRUD operations are working. Instead of databases, use any collection, it is desirable to perform all operations in a separate service that will be present in the controller.
